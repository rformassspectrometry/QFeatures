# Read DIA-NN output as a QFeatures objects

This function takes the `Report.tsv` output files from DIA-NN and
converts them into a multi-set `QFeatures` object. It is a wrapper
around
[`readQFeatures()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/readQFeatures.md)
with default parameters set to match DIA-NN label-free and plexDIA
report files: default `runCol` is `"File.Name"` and default
quantCols`is`"Ms1.Area"\`.

## Usage

``` r
readQFeaturesFromDIANN(
  assayData,
  colData = NULL,
  quantCols = "Ms1.Area",
  runCol = "File.Name",
  multiplexing = c("none", "mTRAQ"),
  extractedData = NULL,
  ecol = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- assayData:

  A `data.frame`, or any object that can be coerced into a `data.frame`,
  holding the quantitative assay. For
  [`readSummarizedExperiment()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/readQFeatures.md),
  this can also be a `character(1)` pointing to a filename. This
  `data.frame` is typically generated by an identification and
  quantification software, such as Sage, Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant,
  ...

- colData:

  A `data.frame` (or any object that can be coerced to a `data.frame`)
  containing sample/column annotations, including `quantCols` and
  `runCol` (see details).

- quantCols:

  A [`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html),
  [`logical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/logical.html) or
  [`character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html) defining the
  columns of the `assayData` that contain the quantitative data. This
  information can also be defined in `colData` (see details).

- runCol:

  For the multi-set case, a `numeric(1)` or `character(1)` pointing to
  the column of `assayData` (and `colData`, is set) that contains the
  runs/batches. Make sure that the column name in both tables are
  identical and syntactically valid (if you supply a `character`) or
  have the same index (if you supply a `numeric`). Note that characters
  are converted to syntactically valid names using `make.names`

- multiplexing:

  A `character(1)` indicating the type of multiplexing used in the
  experiment. One of `"none"` (default, for label-free experiments) or
  `"mTRAQ"` (for plexDIA experiments).

- extractedData:

  A `data.frame` or any object that can be coerced to a `data.frame`
  that contains the data from the `*_ms1_extracted.tsv` file generated
  by DIA-NN. This argument is optional and is currently only applicable
  for mTRAQ multiplexed experiments where DIA-NN was run using the
  `plexdia` module (see references).

- ecol:

  Same as `quantCols`. Available for backwards compatibility. Default is
  `NULL`. If both `ecol` and `colData` are set, an error is thrown.

- verbose:

  A `logical(1)` indicating whether the progress of the data reading and
  formatting should be printed to the console. Default is `TRUE`.

- ...:

  Further arguments passed to
  [`readQFeatures()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/readQFeatures.md).

## Value

An instance of class `QFeatures`. The quantiative data of each
acquisition run is stored in a separate set as a `SummarizedExperiment`
object.
