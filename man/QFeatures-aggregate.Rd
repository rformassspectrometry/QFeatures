\description{
This function aggregates the quantitative features of an assay,
applying a summarisation function (\code{fun}) to sets of features.
The \code{fcol} variable name points to a rowData column that defines
how to group the features during aggregate. This variable can
eigher be a vector (we then refer to an \emph{aggregation by vector})
or an adjacency matrix (\emph{aggregation by matrix}).

The rowData of the aggregated \code{SummarizedExperiment} assay
contains a \code{.n} variable that provides the number of parent
features that were aggregated.

When aggregating with a vector, the newly aggregated
\code{SummarizedExperiment} assay also contains a new \code{aggcounts} assay
containing the aggregation counts matrix, i.e. the number of
features that were aggregated for each sample, which can be
accessed with the \code{aggcounts()} accessor.
}
\details{
Aggregation is performed by a function that takes a matrix as
input and returns a vector of length equal to \code{ncol(x)}. Examples
thereof are
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[MsCoreUtils:medianPolish]{MsCoreUtils::medianPolish()}} to fits an additive model (two way
decomposition) using Tukey's median polish_ procedure using
\code{\link[stats:medpolish]{stats::medpolish()}};
\item \code{\link[MsCoreUtils:robustSummary]{MsCoreUtils::robustSummary()}} to calculate a robust aggregation
using \code{\link[MASS:rlm]{MASS::rlm()}} (default);
\item \code{\link[base:colSums]{base::colMeans()}} to use the mean of each column;
\item \code{colMeansMat(x, MAT)} to aggregate feature by the calculating
the mean of peptide intensities via an adjacency matrix. Shared
peptides are re-used multiple times.
\item \code{\link[matrixStats:rowMedians]{matrixStats::colMedians()}} to use the median of each column.
\item \code{\link[base:colSums]{base::colSums()}} to use the sum of each column;
\item \code{colSumsMat(x, MAT)} to aggregate feature by the summing the
peptide intensities for each protein via an adjacency
matrix. Shared peptides are re-used multiple times.
}

See \code{\link[MsCoreUtils:aggregate]{MsCoreUtils::aggregate_by_vector()}} for more aggregation functions.
}
\section{Missing quantitative values}{


Missing quantitative values have different effects based on the
aggregation method employed:
\itemize{
\item The aggregation functions should be able to deal with missing
values by either ignoring or propagating them. This is often
done with an \code{na.rm} argument, that can be passed with
\code{...}. For example, \code{rowSums}, \code{rowMeans}, \code{rowMedians},
... will ignore \code{NA} values with \code{na.rm = TRUE}, as illustrated
below.
\item Missing values will result in an error when using \code{medpolish},
unless \code{na.rm = TRUE} is used. Note that this option relies on
implicit assumptions and/or performes an implicit imputation:
when summing, the values are implicitly imputed by 0, assuming
that the \code{NA} represent a trully absent features; when
averaging, the assumption is that the \code{NA} represented a
genuinely missing value.
\item When using robust summarisation, individual missing values are
excluded prior to fitting the linear model by robust
regression. To remove all values in the feature containing the
missing values, use \code{\link[=filterNA]{filterNA()}}.
}

More generally, missing values often need dedicated handling such
as filtering (see \code{\link[=filterNA]{filterNA()}}) or imputation (see \code{\link[=impute]{impute()}}).
}

\section{Missing values in the row data}{


Missing values in the row data of an assay will also impact the
resulting (aggregated) assay row data, as illustrated in the
example below. Any feature variables (a column in the row data)
containing \code{NA} values will be dropped from the aggregated row
data. The reasons underlying this drop are detailed in the
\code{reduceDataFrame()} manual page: only invariant aggregated rows,
i.e. rows resulting from the aggregation from identical variables,
are preserved during aggregations.

The situation illustrated below should however only happen in rare
cases and should often be imputable using the value of the other
aggregation rows before aggregation to preserve the invariant
nature of that column. In cases where an \code{NA} is present in an
otherwise variant column, the column would be dropped anyway.
}

\section{Using an adjacency matrix}{


When considering non-unique peptides explicitly, i.e. peptides
that map to multiple proteins rather than as a protein group, it
is convenient to encode this ambiguity explicitly using a
peptide-by-proteins (sparse) adjacency matrix. This matrix is
typically stored in the rowdata and set/retrieved with the
\code{\link[=adjacencyMatrix]{adjacencyMatrix()}} function. It can be created manually (as
illustrated below) or using \code{PSMatch::makeAdjacencyMatrix()}.

rowData(se)$Protein[3] <- c("ProtA;ProtB")
rowData(se)

## This can also be defined using anadjacency matrix, manual

              dimnames = list(rownames(se),
